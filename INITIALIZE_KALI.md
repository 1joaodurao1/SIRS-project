## Initialize Kali

- As a first step, associate the downloaded image to the virtual machine

- Next, customize the VM. Set at least 2GB of memory. For the workstations in the lab, choose 4GB
(4096 MB). Then adjust the number of CPUs according to your physical machine

- Finally, adjust the storage size to at least 20GB (Change this later)


### Starting Kali Linux

- Once the VM boots up, select "Graphical Install" and then press enter.
- Choose your desired settings or follow the predefined options to complete the installation process
- Finally, make sure to install the GRUB boot loader on your main partition

After the setup is finished, log in to confirm everything is correct.

How to set up postgresql database (before running server):

    1.Ensure PostgreSQL Is Running
        sudo service postgresql start

    2.Login to PostgreSQL
        sudo -u postgres psql

    3.Create the Database
        CREATE DATABASE cardb;  # Name configured in application.properties
        (\l to see databases)

    4. Create the User sirs
        CREATE USER sirs WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'sirs';
        (\du to see users)

    5. Grant Permissions to the User
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE cardb TO sirs;

    6. Exit psql prompt:
        \q

    To see if everything is ok:
        Run server:
            You should see some logs like: ...create table ...
        Check database:
            psql -U sirs -d cardb # Connect to the cardb database with new user
            \dt # List the tables in the cardb database. See if our tables are there !



Server important notes:
    Atm, we have setup mutual autentication tls, but not being enabled, only regular tls being used -> Update
    DB is running in same as application server atm (will change later probably and use DMZ)
    Slightly changed configurations of certificates of server and manufacturer (added CN localhost to enable https basically)
    Database is initialized with an initial configuration
